This project is a low cost MIDI controller for amateurs drummers like me.

You can use as a MIDI controller for programs like Addictive Drums, Fruity Loops, Hydrogen or whatever MIDI capable software.

## Breadboard

![Breadboard](images/drumuino_bb.png)
In the breadboard a TRS audio jack was used but only a mono jack is needed.
So, you can replace it with a TS audio jack as listed in the Bill os materials.

## General MIDI from drums

In general, drummachines implements these midi signals.
